Refined Prompt:
You are a Python code tutor and explainer. I will provide you with a Python script, and your task is to add detailed, line-by-line comments explaining everything happening in the code. For each line, include:

* The purpose of the line in the program's logic.
* Explanations of data types and how they are used.
* Details of control structures like `for` loops, `while` loops, `if` statements.
* Descriptions of built-in functions and any method calls.
* Any subtle Python behaviors that might affect execution.
* Explanations of the workflow: how data moves through the program, how functions interact, and the overall program flow.
* Examples or analogies to clarify concepts, when relevant.

Your comments should be verbose and educational, effectively turning the code into a learning guide for someone studying Python, from beginner to intermediate level. Preserve the original code structure and functionality, only adding explanatory comments above or beside each line.

Enhancements:

* Include occasional "learning notes" that highlight common pitfalls or best practices.
* Include a summary of the overall workflow of the program at the start and end, describing how all components interact.
* Color-code or format comments in a way that visually separates explanations from code, if possible in the environment.
* Optionally, summarize the overall logic of each function or block after explaining individual lines.

#function problems level 1 (chatGPT￼) 

# ============================================================================
# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem asks us to create a function that performs basic addition.
# The function should accept two numeric parameters (integers or floats) and
# return their sum. This is a fundamental arithmetic operation that demonstrates
# function definition, parameters, and return statements in Python.
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Function must take exactly two numeric parameters
# - Function must return the sum of the two parameters
# - Should work with both integers and floating-point numbers
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - add_numbers(5, 5) should return 10
# - add_numbers(3.5, 2.5) should return 6.0
# - add_numbers(-10, 15) should return 5
# ============================================================================
"""
Problem 1:
Write a Python function called `add_numbers` that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum.
"""

# SOLUTION EXPLANATION:
# This is a concise one-liner solution that directly returns the sum.
# The function takes two parameters 'a' and 'b' which can be any numeric type.
# The '+' operator works with integers, floats, and even complex numbers.
# This approach is memory-efficient as it doesn't store intermediate values.
#==============================================================================
# FUNCTION DEFINITION: 'add_number'
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose: This line defines a reusable function named 'add_number'.
# In Python, functions are defined using the 'def' keyword followed by the function name.
# Functions allow us to organize code into reusable blocks that can be called multiple times.
# Parameters: This function accepts 2 parameter(s): a, b
# Parameters are variables that receive values when the function is called.
# They act as placeholders for the actual data that will be passed to the function.
# The colon (:) at the end is REQUIRED - it tells Python that the function body follows.
# The function body must be indented (typically 4 spaces) to show it belongs to this function.
#==============================================================================
def add_number(a, b):
# FUNCTION SUMMARY: This function is now defined and ready to be called.
# To use it, call the function name followed by parentheses with any required arguments.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# RETURN STATEMENT:
# Purpose: This exits the function immediately and sends a value back to the caller.
# When a 'return' statement executes, the function stops running and control returns to where it was called.
# Returning: a + b  # Returns the sum of parameters a and b
# The '+' operator performs addition for numbers or concatenation for strings.
# LEARNING NOTE: Python's '+' is polymorphic - it behaves differently based on data types.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    return a + b  # Returns the sum of parameters a and b
    
# TEST CASE:
# This demonstrates the function with two positive integers (5 and 5).
# The expected result is 10, which will be printed to the console.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PRINT STATEMENT: Output to console
# Purpose: This displays text or values to the standard output (usually the terminal/console).
# The print() function is one of the most commonly used functions for debugging and user interaction.
# Printing: add_number(5, 5
# LEARNING NOTE: print() automatically converts values to strings and adds a newline at the end.
# You can print multiple items separated by commas - they'll be printed with spaces between them.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
print(add_number(5, 5))  # Output: 10
    
# ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION EXPLANATION:
# This solution uses an intermediate variable to store the result before returning.
# While functionally identical to the previous solution, this approach can be
# more readable for beginners and allows for easier debugging if you need to
# inspect the value before returning. The variable 'result' holds the sum.

"""

# SOLUTION EXPLANATION (Using Built-in Function):
# This solution uses Python's built-in max() function, which is the most

# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem asks us to count the number of vowels in a given string.
# Vowels are defined as the letters: a, e, i, o, u (both lowercase and uppercase).
# The problem specifies to ignore case sensitivity, meaning 'A' and 'a' should
# both be counted as vowels. This is a common string processing task.
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Function must accept a string as input
# - Function must count vowels: a, e, i, o, u (case-insensitive)
# - Must return the total count of vowels found
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - count_vowels("Jonathan") should return 3 (o, a, a)
# - count_vowels("Hello") should return 2 (e, o)
# - count_vowels("AEIOU") should return 5 (all vowels)
# - count_vowels("xyz") should return 0 (no vowels)
# 
# Note: The current solution only checks lowercase vowels, which may not
# fully satisfy the case-insensitive requirement. A better solution would
# convert the string to lowercase first.

"""

# SOLUTION EXPLANATION:
# This solution iterates through each character in the string and checks if
# it's a vowel. However, it only checks against lowercase vowels "aeiou",

# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem requires calculating the square of a number. The square of a

# Key Requirements:
# - Function must accept a number (integer or float) as input
# - Function must return the square (number × number)
# - Should work with both positive and negative numbers
# 
# Mathematical Definition:
# - Square of n = n × n = n²
# - Square of -5 = (-5) × (-5) = 25 (squares are always positive or zero)

# - calculate_square(3.5) should return 12.25 (3.5 × 3.5)
# 
# Note: The first solution has a bug - it uses number ** number (power operation)
# instead of number ** 2, which would calculate number to the power of itself
# rather than the square. For example, 9 ** 9 = 387,420,489, not 81.

# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem asks us to determine if a string is a palindrome. A palindrome
# is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same forwards and backwards.
# Examples include "racecar", "level", and "madam". The function should handle
# case-insensitivity and ignore spaces for phrases like "A man a plan a canal Panama".
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Function must accept a string as input
# - Function must return True if the string is a palindrome, False otherwise
# - Should handle case-insensitivity (treat 'A' and 'a' as the same)
# - Should ignore spaces (for multi-word palindromes)
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - is_palindrome("racecar") should return True (reads same forwards/backwards)
# - is_palindrome("level") should return True
# - is_palindrome("tom") should return False (tom != mot)
# - is_palindrome("A man a plan a canal Panama") should return True (ignoring case/spaces)
# 
# Algorithm: Compare the string with its reverse after normalizing (lowercase, no spaces).

# Purpose: This executes a function that was defined earlier in the code.

# CORRECT SOLUTION EXPLANATION (Using Built-in Function):
# This solution uses Python's built-in min() function, which is the most
# efficient and Pythonic way to find the minimum value. The min() function
# internally iterates through the list and returns the smallest element.
# This is the recommended approach for production code.

# FUNCTION DEFINITION: 'find_last_element'
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose: This line defines a reusable function named 'find_last_element'.
# In Python, functions are defined using the 'def' keyword followed by the function name.
# Functions allow us to organize code into reusable blocks that can be called multiple times.
# Parameters: This function accepts 1 parameter(s): string
# Parameters are variables that receive values when the function is called.
# They act as placeholders for the actual data that will be passed to the function.
# The colon (:) at the end is REQUIRED - it tells Python that the function body follows.
# The function body must be indented (typically 4 spaces) to show it belongs to this function.
#==============================================================================
def find_last_element(string):
# FUNCTION SUMMARY: This function is now defined and ready to be called.
# To use it, call the function name followed by parentheses with any required arguments.
    # [-1] is Python's negative index for the last element
    # This works for any sequence type (list, tuple, string, etc.)
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# RETURN STATEMENT:
# Purpose: This exits the function immediately and sends a value back to the caller.
# When a 'return' statement executes, the function stops running and control returns to where it was called.
# Returning: string[-1]  # Returns the last element
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Purpose: This creates a new variable or updates an existing one with a value.
# In Python, variables are created when you first assign a value to them (no declaration needed).
# Variable name: 'lst' - follows Python naming conventions (lowercase with underscores).
# Data Type: LIST - an ordered, mutable collection of items.
# Lists are created with square brackets [] and can contain any data types.
# Lists are indexed starting from 0, and items can be added, removed, or modified.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem requires calculating the product (multiplication result) of all

# return the total product. This is similar to sum, but uses multiplication.
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Function must accept a list of numbers
# - Function must return the product of all numbers
# - Product of [a, b, c] = a × b × c
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - multiply_elements([2, 4, 2]) should return 16 (2 × 4 × 2)
# - multiply_elements([100, 200, 900]) should return 18,000,000
# - multiply_elements([1, 2, 3, 4]) should return 24
# - multiply_elements([5]) should return 5 (single element)
# 
# Edge Cases:
# - Empty list would need special handling (product of empty list is typically 1)
# - Product with zero results in zero

# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem requires counting how many times a specific element appears in
# a list. The function should take a list and a target element, then return
# the count of occurrences of that element. This is a common operation in
# data analysis and text processing.
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Function must accept a list and a target element
# - Function must return the count of how many times target appears
# - Should work with any type of elements (numbers, strings, etc.)
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - count_occurrences(["tree", "house", "tree", "car"], "tree") should return 2
# - count_occurrences([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 2, 3], 2) should return 3
# - count_occurrences([1, 2, 3], 5) should return 0 (not found)
# 
# Algorithm: Iterate through list, increment counter when element matches target.
# ============================================================================
"""
Problem 27:
# The 'in' operator checks if a value exists in a sequence (membership test).
# Returns True if found, False otherwise.
Write a Python function called `count_occurrences` that takes a list and an element as input and returns the number of times the element appears in the list.
"""

# This problem requires removing all vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from a string.
# The function should take a string and return a new string with all vowel
# characters removed, keeping only consonants and other characters. This is

# Key Requirements:
# - Function must accept a string as input
# - Function must return a new string with vowels removed
# - Should handle both uppercase and lowercase vowels (case-insensitive)
# - Non-vowel characters (consonants, numbers, symbols) should remain
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - remove_vowels("Jonathan") should return "Jnthn" (removes o, a, a)
# - remove_vowels("Hello World") should return "Hll Wrld"
# - remove_vowels("AEIOU") should return "" (all vowels removed)

# - Must reverse the order of words (not characters within words)
# - Words are separated by spaces
# - Should return a new string (not modify original)
# - Original word order should be reversed
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - reverse_words("hello world") should return "world hello"
# - reverse_words("Jonathan moll") should return "moll Jonathan"
# - reverse_words("the quick brown fox") should return "fox brown quick the"
# - reverse_words("single") should return "single" (one word, no change)
#

# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem requires finding the longest word in a string or list of words.
# The function should take a string (or list) of words and return the word
# with the maximum length. If multiple words have the same maximum length,
# return the first one encountered. This is a common text processing operation.
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Function must accept a string of words (or list of words)
# - Function must return the longest word
# - If multiple words have same length, return the first one
# - Words are typically separated by spaces in strings
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - find_longest_word("why dont you call Jonathan") should return "Jonathan" (8 chars)
# - find_longest_word(["tree", "cliff", "mountain"]) should return "mountain" (8 chars)
# - find_longest_word(["a", "bb", "ccc"]) should return "ccc" (3 chars)
# 
# Algorithm: Compare word lengths, track the longest word found.
# ============================================================================
"""
Problem 34:
# The 'in' operator checks if a value exists in a sequence (membership test).
# Returns True if found, False otherwise.
Write a Python function called find_longest_word that takes a string of words as input and returns the longest word in the list. If there are multiple longest words, return the first one encountered.
"""

# SOLUTION EXPLANATION (Using max() with key):
# This solution uses Python's built-in max() function with a key parameter.
# The key=len tells max() to compare words by their length. This is the most
# concise and Pythonic approach. max() automatically returns the first maximum
# if there are ties, which matches the requirement.

# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem requires reversing the digits of an integer. The function should
# take a number like 123 and return 321 (digits in reverse order). This is
# achieved by converting the number to a string, reversing it, then converting
# back to an integer. This is a common number manipulation operation.
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Function must accept an integer as input
# - Function must return an integer with digits reversed
# - Leading zeros in the result are dropped (e.g., 100 → 1, not 001)
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - reverse_number(123) should return 321
# - reverse_number(100) should return 1 (leading zeros dropped)
# - reverse_number(4567) should return 7654
# - reverse_number(-123) should return -321 (negative sign preserved)
# 
# Algorithm: Convert to string, reverse using slicing, convert back to int.

# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem requires calculating the sum of all numbers in a list. The
# function should take a list of numbers and return their total sum. This is
# a fundamental list operation that's commonly used in data processing and
# mathematical calculations. The problem appears twice (38 and 39) with
# different implementations - one with user input, one with direct list input.
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Function must accept a list of numbers
# - Function must return the sum of all numbers
# - Should work with integers, floats, and mixed numeric types
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - sum_of_list([2, 2, 2]) should return 6
# - sum_of_list([1, 2, 3, 4]) should return 10
# - sum_of_list([10, 20, 30]) should return 60
# 
# Python provides a built-in sum() function, but the problem can also be
# solved manually using a loop to demonstrate the algorithm.
# ============================================================================
"""
Problem: 38
# The 'in' operator checks if a value exists in a sequence (membership test).

# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem requires creating a new list where each number from the input
# list is squared (multiplied by itself). The function should take a list of
# numbers and return a new list with each element's value squared. This is
# a common list transformation operation used in mathematical computations.
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Function must accept a list of numbers
# - Function must return a NEW list (not modify original)
# - Each element in the new list should be the square of the corresponding element
# - Square of n = n × n = n²
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - square_elements([2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) should return [4, 9, 16, 25, 36]
# - square_elements([1, 2, 3]) should return [1, 4, 9]
# - square_elements([-2, 0, 2]) should return [4, 0, 4]
# 
# WARNING: The current solution has a bug! It uses number ** number instead
# of number ** 2, which calculates number to the power of itself, not squared.

# Example Input/Output:
# - remove_spaces("what happening boss man") should return "whathappeningbossman"
# - remove_spaces("hello world") should return "helloworld"

# - Function must accept a string as input
# - Function must return True if palindrome, False otherwise
# - Should check if string == reversed string
# - Case-sensitive by default (unless specified otherwise)
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - is_palindrome("racecar") should return True (reads same forwards/backwards)
# - is_palindrome("hello") should return False (hello != olleh)
# - is_palindrome("level") should return True
# - is_palindrome("Racecar") should return False (case-sensitive: R != r)

# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem requires calculating the factorial of a non-negative integer.
# The factorial of n (denoted as n!) is the product of all positive integers
# from 1 to n. By definition, 0! = 1. Factorials grow very quickly and are
# used in combinatorics, probability, and mathematical analysis.
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Function must accept a non-negative integer n
# - Function must return n! = n × (n-1) × (n-2) × ... × 2 × 1
# - Special case: 0! = 1 (by mathematical definition)
# - Should handle edge cases (0, 1)
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - factorial(0) should return 1 (0! = 1 by definition)
# - factorial(5) should return 120 (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120)
# - factorial(1) should return 1 (1! = 1)
# - factorial(3) should return 6 (3 × 2 × 1 = 6)
# 
# Algorithm: Can be implemented iteratively (loop) or recursively.

# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - count_words("This is a test. This test is only a test.") should return
#   {'this': 2, 'is': 2, 'a': 2, 'test.': 1, 'test': 1, 'only': 1}

# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem requires generating and printing the Fibonacci sequence up to
# a given limit. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each
# subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. The program should use
# a while loop to generate numbers until they exceed the limit.
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Program must prompt user for a limit
# - Must use a while loop (as specified)
# - Should print Fibonacci numbers up to (and including) the limit
# - Sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - If user enters limit=10, output: "0 1 1 2 3 5 8"
# - If user enters limit=20, output: "0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13"

# FUNCTION DEFINITION: 'count_vowels'
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose: This line defines a reusable function named 'count_vowels'.
# In Python, functions are defined using the 'def' keyword followed by the function name.
# Functions allow us to organize code into reusable blocks that can be called multiple times.
# Parameters: None - this function takes no arguments.
# The colon (:) at the end is REQUIRED - it tells Python that the function body follows.
# The function body must be indented (typically 4 spaces) to show it belongs to this function.

# VARIABLE ASSIGNMENT: 'user'
# Purpose: This creates a new variable or updates an existing one with a value.
# In Python, variables are created when you first assign a value to them (no declaration needed).
# Variable name: 'user' - follows Python naming conventions (lowercase with underscores).
# This assigns the RESULT of a function call to the variable.

# Variable name: 'vowels' - follows Python naming conventions (lowercase with underscores).
# Data Type: STRING - a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.
# Strings in Python are immutable - you cannot change individual characters, only create new strings.
# Python supports single quotes ('), double quotes ("), and triple quotes for multi-line strings.

# IF STATEMENT: Conditional execution
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose: This code block will only execute if the condition evaluates to True.
# IF statements allow your program to make decisions and execute code conditionally.
# Condition: char in vowels:  # If char is 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u'
# Python evaluates this condition as either True or False (boolean values).
# Comparison operators: == (equal), != (not equal), < (less than), > (greater than), <=, >=
# Logical operators: 'and' (both true), 'or' (either true), 'not' (inverse)
# The colon (:) is REQUIRED - it indicates the start of the conditional block.

# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem requires calculating the factorial of a number. The factorial
# of n (n!) is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n. By definition,
# 0! = 1. The program should prompt the user for a number and calculate its
# factorial. This is a fundamental mathematical operation.
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Program must prompt user for a number
# - Must calculate n! = n × (n-1) × (n-2) × ... × 2 × 1
# - Should display the result
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - If user enters 5, output: 120 (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120)
# - If user enters 3, output: 6 (3 × 2 × 1 = 6)
# - If user enters 0, output: 1 (0! = 1 by definition)
# 
# Algorithm: Initialize result=1, multiply by each number from 1 to n.

# ============================================================================
# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem requires finding the largest element in a list of strings (not
# numbers). "Largest" here means the longest string (most characters). The
# program should find the string with the maximum length. This is useful for
# text processing and finding the longest word in a list.
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Function must accept a list of strings
# - Must find the string with maximum length
# - Should not use numeric comparisons (compare by length instead)
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - largest_element(["tree", "cliff", "mountain"]) should return "mountain" (8 chars)
# - largest_element(["house", "counter", "if"]) should return "counter" (7 chars)
# - largest_element(["a", "bb", "ccc"]) should return "ccc" (3 chars)
# 
# Algorithm: Compare strings by their length, track the longest one.
# ============================================================================
"""
Problem: 65
# The 'in' operator checks if a value exists in a sequence (membership test).
# Returns True if found, False otherwise.

"""

# SOLUTION EXPLANATION (Using max() with key):
# This solution uses Python's max() function with key=len to find the string
# with the maximum length. The key parameter tells max() to compare elements
# by their length rather than alphabetically. This is the most concise approach.

# Variable name: 'numbers' - follows Python naming conventions (lowercase with underscores).
# This assigns the RESULT of a function call to the variable.

# Methods are functions attached to objects and are accessed using dot notation (object.method).
# Object: 'unique_numbers' - the variable or object we're calling the method on.
# Method: 'sort()' - the function we're calling.
# Common string methods: .upper(), .lower(), .strip(), .split(), .replace()
# Common list methods: .append(), .remove(), .pop(), .sort(), .reverse()
# LEARNING NOTE: Methods can modify the object (in-place) or return a new value.

# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem requires validating whether a given string is a valid email
# address. An email address typically has the format: local@domain.extension
# where local can contain letters, numbers, and certain special characters,
# and domain must have at least one dot separating the domain name from the
# extension (TLD). The program should use validation rules to check if the
# email format is correct.
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Program must prompt user for an email address
# - Must validate email format (local@domain.extension)
# - Should check for required components (@ symbol, domain, TLD)
# - Should return True if valid, False otherwise
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - "user@example.com" → True (valid email)
# - "invalid.email" → False (missing @)
# - "@example.com" → False (missing local part)
# - "user@.com" → False (invalid domain)
# 
# Algorithm: Use regex pattern matching or manual validation of components.

# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem requires calculating the factorial of a number using recursion.
# The factorial of n (n!) is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n.
# By definition, 0! = 1 and 1! = 1. The recursive approach breaks down the
# problem: n! = n × (n-1)!, with base cases for n=0 and n=1.
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Program must prompt user for a number
# - Must use recursion (function calls itself)
# - Should calculate n! = n × (n-1) × (n-2) × ... × 2 × 1
# - Should handle edge cases (0, 1, negative numbers)
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - factorial(5) = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
# - factorial(3) = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6
# - factorial(0) = 1 (base case)
# 
# Algorithm: Base case: if n <= 1, return 1. Otherwise: return n × factorial(n-1)
# ============================================================================
"""
Problem: 73

"""

# SOLUTION EXPLANATION:
# This solution uses recursion to calculate factorial. The function calls
# itself with a smaller value until it reaches the base case (n=0 or n=1),
# then returns 1. Each recursive call multiplies the current n by the result
# of factorial(n-1), building up the final product.

# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem requires checking if two strings are anagrams of each other.
# Anagrams are words or phrases formed by rearranging the letters of another
# word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once. For example,
# "listen" and "silent" are anagrams. The program should ignore case and
# spaces when comparing.
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Program must prompt user for two strings
# - Must check if strings are anagrams (same letters, different order)
# - Should ignore case (treat 'A' same as 'a')
# - Should ignore spaces
# - Should display whether strings are anagrams
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - "listen" and "silent" → anagrams
# - "hello" and "world" → not anagrams
# - "The Morse Code" and "Here come dots" → anagrams (after normalization)

"""
Problem: 75
Write a Python program to check if a number is a prime number. Prompt the user to enter a number.
"""

# SOLUTION EXPLANATION (Optimized Prime Check):
# This solution uses an optimized algorithm that:
# 1. Handles edge cases (n <= 1, n <= 3)
# 2. Quickly eliminates even numbers and multiples of 3
# 3. Only checks divisors up to sqrt(n) using 6k±1 pattern
# This is much more efficient than checking all numbers up to n.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose: This line defines a reusable function named 'is_prime'.
# In Python, functions are defined using the 'def' keyword followed by the function name.
# Functions allow us to organize code into reusable blocks that can be called multiple times.
# Parameters: This function accepts 1 parameter(s): n
# Parameters are variables that receive values when the function is called.
# They act as placeholders for the actual data that will be passed to the function.
# The colon (:) at the end is REQUIRED - it tells Python that the function body follows.
# The function body must be indented (typically 4 spaces) to show it belongs to this function.

# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem requires finding elements that appear in both lists (intersection).
# The program should identify all elements that are present in both input lists,
# regardless of their positions. Duplicates should be handled appropriately
# (typically, each common element appears once in the result).
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Program must prompt user for two lists
# - Must find elements present in both lists
# - Should handle duplicates appropriately
# - Should display the common elements
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - common_elements(["tree", "house", "car"], ["house", "tree", "sky"]) → ["tree", "house"]
# - common_elements([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]) → [] (no common elements)
# - common_elements([1, 2, 2, 3], [2, 2, 4]) → [2] (duplicates handled)
# 
# Algorithm: Can use nested loops, set intersection, or list comprehension.
# ============================================================================

# SOLUTION EXPLANATION (Using Nested Loops):
# This solution uses nested loops to compare each element in the first list

# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem requires calculating the square root of a number. The square
# root of a number n is a value that, when multiplied by itself, equals n.
# For example, the square root of 9 is 3 (3 × 3 = 9). The program should
# prompt the user for a number and calculate its square root.
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Program must prompt user for a number
# - Must calculate the square root
# - Should handle floating-point numbers (decimals)
# - Should display the result
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - square_root(9) → 3.0
# - square_root(16) → 4.0
# - square_root(2) → 1.414... (approximate)
# 
# Algorithm: Use exponentiation (num ** 0.5) or math.sqrt() function.

# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem requires checking if a string is a palindrome using a recursive

# last characters, then recursively check the substring. A palindrome reads
# the same forwards and backwards (e.g., "racecar", "level").
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Program must prompt user for a string
# - Should check if string is a palindrome (ideally using recursion)
# - Should handle case-insensitivity and spaces
# - Should display whether string is a palindrome
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - "racecar" → palindrome
# - "hello" → not palindrome
# - "A man a plan" → palindrome (after normalization)
# 
# Note: Current solution uses slicing, not true recursion.

# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem requires counting the number of words in a sentence. The program
# should prompt the user for a sentence, then count how many words it contains.
# Words are typically separated by whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines). This is
# a fundamental text processing operation used in many applications.
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Program must prompt user for a sentence
# - Must count words (separated by whitespace)
# - Should return or display the word count
# - Should handle multiple spaces correctly
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - Input: "Jonathan is the best ever" → Output: 5 words
# - Input: "Hello   world" → Output: 2 words (multiple spaces handled)
# - Input: "Python" → Output: 1 word
# 
# Algorithm: Split sentence by whitespace, count the resulting list elements.

# SOLUTION EXPLANATION:
# This solution uses Python's split() method to divide the sentence into words,
# then manually counts them using a loop. While this works, using len() on the

# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem requires finding both the largest (maximum) and smallest
# (minimum) elements in a list of numbers. The program should prompt the user
# for a list of numbers, then identify both values. The problem specifies not
# to use sorted(), so we need to find them manually. This is more efficient
# than sorting the entire list when we only need the extremes.
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Program must prompt user for a list of numbers
# - Must find both minimum and maximum values
# - Should NOT use sorted() (as specified)
# - Should return or display both values
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - Input: [4, 5, 100, 6, 1, 10] → Output: (1, 100) or smallest=1, largest=100
# - Input: [10, 20, 30] → Output: (10, 30)
# - Input: [-5, 0, 5] → Output: (-5, 5)
# 
# Algorithm: Single-pass iteration - track min and max as we go through the list.
# ============================================================================
"""
Problem 91:
# The 'in' operator checks if a value exists in a sequence (membership test).
# Returns True if found, False otherwise.

"""

# SOLUTION EXPLANATION:
# This solution uses a single-pass algorithm that finds both minimum and maximum
# in one iteration through the list. It's more efficient than calling min() and
# max() separately (which would require two passes) or sorting (which is O(n log n)).
# The algorithm initializes both min and max with the first element, then updates
# them as it encounters smaller or larger values.

# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem requires determining if a number is a perfect number. A perfect
# number is a positive integer that equals the sum of its proper divisors
# (all positive divisors except the number itself). For example, 6 is perfect
# because its proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. This is a
# mathematical problem that demonstrates loops, conditionals, and arithmetic.
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Program must prompt user for a number
# - Must check if number is perfect (sum of proper divisors = number)
# - Proper divisors exclude the number itself
# - Should handle edge cases (negative numbers, zero)
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - Input: 6 → Output: True (1 + 2 + 3 = 6)
# - Input: 28 → Output: True (1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28)
# - Input: 10 → Output: False (1 + 2 + 5 = 8 ≠ 10)
# 
# Algorithm: Find all proper divisors, sum them, compare with original number.

# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem requires calculating the factorial of a number using a loop.
# The factorial of n (denoted as n!) is the product of all positive integers
# from 1 to n. For example, 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120. The program should
# prompt the user for a number and calculate its factorial iteratively (using
# a loop) rather than recursively. This demonstrates iteration and accumulation.
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Program must prompt user for a number
# - Must use a loop (as specified)
# - Must calculate factorial: n! = n × (n-1) × (n-2) × ... × 2 × 1
# - Should handle edge cases (0! = 1 by definition)
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - Input: 5 → Output: 120 (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)
# - Input: 0 → Output: 1 (0! = 1 by definition)
# - Input: 3 → Output: 6 (3 × 2 × 1)
# 
# Algorithm: Initialize result to 1, multiply by each number from 1 to n.
# ============================================================================
"""
Problem 93:
Write a Python program to find the factorial of a number using a loop. Prompt the user to enter a number.
"""

# SOLUTION EXPLANATION:
# This solution uses an iterative approach with a for loop to calculate factorial.
# It initializes the result to 1 (the multiplicative identity), then multiplies
# by each number from 1 to n. This is efficient and avoids stack overflow issues
# that recursion might have for large numbers.

# FUNCTION DEFINITION: 'remove_vowels'
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose: This line defines a reusable function named 'remove_vowels'.
# In Python, functions are defined using the 'def' keyword followed by the function name.
# Functions allow us to organize code into reusable blocks that can be called multiple times.
# Parameters: None - this function takes no arguments.
# The colon (:) at the end is REQUIRED - it tells Python that the function body follows.
# The function body must be indented (typically 4 spaces) to show it belongs to this function.

# VARIABLE ASSIGNMENT: 'user'
# Purpose: This creates a new variable or updates an existing one with a value.
# In Python, variables are created when you first assign a value to them (no declaration needed).
# Variable name: 'user' - follows Python naming conventions (lowercase with underscores).
# This assigns the RESULT of a function call to the variable.
# The function executes first, and its return value is stored in the variable.

# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem requires checking if two strings are anagrams of each other,
# ignoring whitespace. Anagrams are words or phrases formed by rearranging
# the letters of another, using all the original letters exactly once. The
# program should prompt the user for two strings and determine if they contain
# the same letters (ignoring spaces and case differences).
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Program must prompt user for two strings
# - Must check if strings are anagrams
# - Should ignore whitespace
# - Should handle case-insensitivity (typically)
# - All letters from one string must be present in the other
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - Input: "listen", "silent" → Output: True (same letters)
# - Input: "The Morse Code", "Here come dots" → Output: True (anagram, ignoring spaces)
# - Input: "hello", "world" → Output: False (different letters)
# 
# Algorithm: Remove whitespace, sort both strings, compare sorted versions.

# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Program must prompt user for a list of numbers
# - Must identify odd numbers (not divisible by 2)
# - Must sum only the odd numbers
# - Should return or display the sum
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] → Output: 9 (1 + 3 + 5)
# - Input: [10, 20, 30] → Output: 0 (no odd numbers)

# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem requires finding characters that appear in both strings. The
# program should prompt the user for two strings, then identify and return
# the characters that are common to both strings. This is useful for text
# analysis and comparison operations.
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Program must prompt user for two strings
# - Must find characters present in both strings
# - Should handle duplicates appropriately
# - May need to handle case sensitivity
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - Input: "hello", "world" → Output: ['l', 'o'] (common characters)
# - Input: "python", "programming" → Output: ['p', 'r', 'o', 'g', 'n']
# - Input: "abc", "xyz" → Output: [] (no common characters)
# 
# Algorithm: Find intersection of character sets from both strings.

# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem requires counting both vowels and consonants in a string.
# Vowels are typically a, e, i, o, u (and sometimes y), while consonants are
# all other letters. The program should prompt the user for a string, then
# count and display both the number of vowels and consonants separately.
# This demonstrates character classification and counting operations.
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Program must prompt user for a string
# - Must count vowels (a, e, i, o, u)
# - Must count consonants (all other letters)
# - Should ignore non-letter characters (numbers, spaces, punctuation)
# - Should handle case-insensitivity
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - Input: "Hello World" → Output: Vowels: 3, Consonants: 7
# - Input: "Python" → Output: Vowels: 1, Consonants: 5
# 
# Algorithm: Iterate through string, classify each letter as vowel or consonant.

# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem requires creating a function that checks if a string is a
# palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards (e.g., "radar",
# "level", "madam"). The function should return True if the string is a
# palindrome, False otherwise. This is a common string manipulation and
# validation problem.
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Function must accept a string as input
# - Must check if string reads same forwards and backwards
# - Should return True if palindrome, False otherwise
# - May need to handle case sensitivity and spaces
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - is_palindrome("radar") → True (reads same both ways)
# - is_palindrome("hello") → False (hello ≠ olleh)
# - is_palindrome("level") → True
# 
# Algorithm: Compare string with its reverse using slicing [::-1].

# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem requires checking if two lists have any elements in common.
# The function should take two lists and return True if they share at least
# one element, False otherwise. The problem suggests using nested loops as
# an exercise, though using the 'in' operator would be more Pythonic. This
# demonstrates list comparison and nested iteration.
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Function must accept two lists as input
# - Must check if any element appears in both lists
# - Should return True if at least one common element exists
# - Should use nested loops (as exercise requirement)
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - overlapping([1, 2, 3], [3, 4, 5]) → True (3 is common)
# - overlapping([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]) → False (no common elements)
# - overlapping(["a", "b"], ["b", "c"]) → True ("b" is common)
# 
# Algorithm: Nested loops - check each element of first list against each
# element of second list, return True if any match found.
# ============================================================================
"""
Problem 124:
Define a function overlapping() that takes two lists and returns True if they have at least one member in common, False otherwise. You may use your is_member() function, or the in operator, but for the sake of the exercise, you should (also) write it using two nested forloops.

# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem requires creating a text correction function that performs two
# operations: 1) compresses multiple consecutive spaces into a single space,
# and 2) adds a space after a period if it's directly followed by a letter
# (no space). This is useful for cleaning and formatting text. The problem
# suggests using regular expressions for efficient pattern matching.
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Function must accept a string
# - Must compress multiple spaces into one space
# - Must add space after period if followed directly by a letter
# - Should use regular expressions (as suggested)
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - Input: "This is very funny and cool.Indeed!" → Output: "This is very funny and cool. Indeed!"
# - Input: "Hello    world" → Output: "Hello world" (compressed spaces)
# - Input: "Text.  More text" → Output: "Text. More text" (compressed spaces)
# 
# Algorithm: Use regex to replace multiple spaces with one, add space after period+letter.
# ============================================================================
"""
Problem: 130
Define a simple 'spelling correction' function correct() that takes a string and sees to it that 1) two or more occurrences of the space character is compressed into one, and 2) inserts an extra space after a period if the period is directly followed by a letter. E.g. correct('This is very funny and cool.Indeed!'') should return 'This is very funny and cool. Indeed!'' Tip: Use regular expressions!
"""

# SOLUTION EXPLANATION:
# This solution uses Python's re (regular expressions) module to perform both
# corrections efficiently. Regular expressions allow pattern matching and
# replacement in a single operation, making this approach concise and powerful.

# This problem requires using the reduce() function (a higher-order function)
# to find the maximum value in a list. The reduce() function applies a function
# cumulatively to items in a sequence, reducing it to a single value. This
# demonstrates functional programming concepts in Python. The problem also
# asks you to consider why we might wrap reduce() in a function rather than
# calling it directly.
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Function must use reduce() from functools
# - Must find the maximum value in a list
# - Should take a list of numbers as input
# - Should return the largest number
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - Input: [1, 5, 3, 9, 2] → Output: 9
# - Input: [10, 20, 30] → Output: 30
# - Input: [-5, -1, -10] → Output: -1

# In Python, functions are defined using the 'def' keyword followed by the function name.
# Functions allow us to organize code into reusable blocks that can be called multiple times.
# Parameters: This function accepts 1 parameter(s): numbers
# Parameters are variables that receive values when the function is called.
# They act as placeholders for the actual data that will be passed to the function.

# - Elements should appear in original order, then repeat

# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem requires finding elements that appear in both lists using nested

# Key Requirements:

# - Must use nested for loops (as specified)
# - Must find elements common to both lists
# - Should return list of common elements

# Example Input/Output:
# - Input: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] → Output: [2, 3]

# ============================================================================
# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem requires removing duplicate characters from a string without
# preserving order. The function should take a string and return a new string
# containing only unique characters. Since order doesn't need to be maintained,
# we can use a set to efficiently remove duplicates. This is useful for
# character analysis and text processing.
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Function must accept a string as input
# - Must remove duplicate characters
# - Order does NOT need to be preserved (as specified)
# - Should return a new string
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - Input: "hello" → Output: "helo" or "lohe" (order may vary)
# - Input: "programming" → Output: "progamin" (unique chars, order may vary)
# 
# Algorithm: Convert to set (removes duplicates, loses order), join back to string.
# ============================================================================

Problem 156:
Write a Python function called remove_duplicates that takes a string as input and returns a new string with duplicate characters removed, without maintaining the original order of characters.
"""

# SOLUTION EXPLANATION (Note: Implementation Mismatch):
# NOTE: The problem asks for duplicate characters to be removed, but this
# solution removes duplicate words instead. It splits the string into words,
# converts to a set (which removes duplicate words), then joins back. This
# doesn't match the problem requirement for character-level deduplication.

# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem requires finding the largest element in a list using the max()
# function. The program should prompt the user for a list of numbers and return
# the maximum value. This is the most efficient and Pythonic way to find the
# largest element, as max() has O(n) time complexity and is built-in.
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Program must prompt user for a list of numbers
# - Must use max() function (as specified)
# - Must find the largest element
# - Should return or display the result
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - Input: [2, 56, 75, 4566, 3] → Output: 4566
# - Input: [10, 20, 30] → Output: 30

# SOLUTION EXPLANATION:
# This solution uses Python's built-in max() function, which is the most

# SOLUTION EXPLANATION:
# This solution manually calculates length by iterating through the sequence

# ============================================================================
# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem requires counting how many times each vowel appears in a string
# and returning the counts in a dictionary. The function should create a
# dictionary where keys are vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') and values are
# their counts. The problem specifies using list comprehension, and case should
# be ignored (treat 'A' and 'a' as the same).
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Function must accept a string as input
# - Must return a dictionary with vowel counts
# - Keys should be vowels: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'
# - Values should be counts of each vowel
# - Should be case-insensitive
# - Should use list comprehension (as specified)
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - Input: "JOnathAn is the best" → Output: {'a': 2, 'e': 2, 'i': 1, 'o': 1, 'u': 0}
# - Input: "Hello World" → Output: {'a': 0, 'e': 1, 'i': 0, 'o': 2, 'u': 0}
# 
# Algorithm: Use list/dict comprehension to count vowels, or iterate and count.
# ============================================================================
"""
Problem 163:
# The 'in' operator checks if a value exists in a sequence (membership test).
# Returns True if found, False otherwise.
Write a Python function `count_vowels` that takes a string as input and returns a dictionary with the counts of each vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') in the string. Ignore case, so 'A' and 'a' should be counted as the same vowel using list comprehension.
"""

# SOLUTION EXPLANATION (Note: Doesn't Use List Comprehension):
# NOTE: The problem asks for list comprehension, but this solution uses regular
# loops. It initializes a dictionary with all vowels set to 0, then iterates
# through the string and increments counts. While functional, it doesn't use
# list comprehension as required.

# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem requires duplicating all elements in a list of strings. The
# function should take a list and return a new list where each element appears
# twice in sequence. For example, ["tree", "house", "car"] becomes
# ["tree", "house", "car", "tree", "house", "car"]. This is similar to
# Problem 148 but works with strings instead of numbers.
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Function must accept a list of strings
# - Must return a new list with all elements duplicated
# - Elements should appear in original order, then repeat
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - Input: ["tree", "house", "car"] → Output: ["tree", "house", "car", "tree", "house", "car"]
# - Input: ["a", "b"] → Output: ["a", "b", "a", "b"]
# 
# Algorithm: Append all elements twice, or concatenate list with itself.

# SOLUTION EXPLANATION:
# This solution uses two loops to append all elements twice. The first loop

# multiple dictionaries. The function should take a list of dictionaries, find
# all unique keys, and for each key, calculate the average of all values
# associated with that key across all dictionaries. This is useful for
# aggregating data from multiple sources.
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Function must accept a list of dictionaries
# - Must find all keys present in any dictionary
# - Must calculate average of values for each key
# - Should return a new dictionary with averaged values
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - Input: [{'a': 1, 'b': 2}, {'a': 3, 'b': 4}, {'a': 5, 'b': 6}]
#   → Output: {'a': 3.0, 'b': 4.0} (averages)
# 
# Algorithm: Sum values for each key, count occurrences, divide sum by count.

# SOLUTION EXPLANATION:
# This solution uses a two-pass algorithm. First pass: accumulate sums and

# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem requires grouping strings by their first letter. The function
# should take a list of strings and create a dictionary where keys are first
# letters and values are lists of all strings starting with that letter. This
# is useful for organizing and categorizing text data.
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Function must accept a list of strings
# - Must group strings by their first character
# - Keys should be first letters
# - Values should be lists of strings starting with that letter
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - Input: ["apple", "banana", "orange", "cake"]
#   → Output: {'a': ['apple'], 'b': ['banana'], 'o': ['orange'], 'c': ['cake']}
# 
# Algorithm: Iterate through strings, use first character as key, append to list.
# ============================================================================
"""
Problem: 182
# The 'in' operator checks if a value exists in a sequence (membership test).
# Returns True if found, False otherwise.
Write a function group_by_first_letter that takes a list of strings as input and returns a dictionary. The dictionary should group the strings by their first letter. Each key in the dictionary should be a first letter, and the corresponding value should be a list of strings that start with that letter.
"""

# SOLUTION EXPLANATION:
# This solution iterates through each word, extracts the first character using
# index [0], and uses it as a dictionary key. If the key doesn't exist, it
# initializes a list with the word. If it exists, it appends the word to the
# existing list. This groups all words by their first letter.

# ============================================================================
# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem requires checking if two strings are anagrams while ignoring
# whitespace and without using sorted(). Anagrams contain the same letters
# in different orders. The program should prompt the user for two strings,
# remove whitespace, and determine if they contain the same letters. Since
# sorted() is not allowed, we need an alternative approach like counting
# character frequencies.
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Program must prompt user for two strings
# - Must check if strings are anagrams
# - Should ignore whitespace
# - Should NOT use sorted() (as specified)
# - Should handle case-insensitivity (typically)
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - Input: "listen", "silent" → Output: True
# - Input: "The Morse Code", "Here come dots" → Output: True (anagram, ignoring spaces)
# 
# Algorithm: Count character frequencies in both strings, compare counts.

Problem 183:
Write a Python program to check if a string is an anagram of another string, ignoring whitespace. Prompt the user to enter two strings without using sorted().
"""
        
# SOLUTION EXPLANATION:
# This solution removes whitespace and converts to lowercase, then compares
# character frequencies. Without sorted(), we need to count how many times
# each character appears in both strings and compare the counts. If all

# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem requires finding common numbers between lists using set().
# The function should take two lists and identify numbers that appear in both.
# Using set() makes this operation efficient with O(1) average-case lookup
# and optimized intersection operations.
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Function must accept two lists of numbers
# - Must find numbers common to both lists
# - Should use set() (as specified)
# - Should return list of common numbers
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - Input: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] → Output: [2, 3]
# - Input: [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6] → Output: [] (no common numbers)
# 
# Algorithm: Convert lists to sets, use intersection operation, convert back to list.

# numbers and find the largest value using a loop and comparisons. While the
# problem mentions "three numbers", the solution should work for any list length.
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Program must prompt user for a list of numbers
# - Must NOT use max() function (as specified)
# - Must find the largest number
# - Should work for any list length
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - Input: [10, 20, 15, 30] → Output: 30
# - Input: [5, 3, 8] → Output: 8
# 
# Algorithm: Linear search - iterate through list, track maximum found so far.

# Built-in function 'max()' returns the largest value from an iterable or multiple arguments.

# SOLUTION EXPLANATION:
# This solution uses a linear search algorithm to find the maximum. It
# initializes max_number with the first element, then iterates through all
# elements, updating max_number whenever a larger value is encountered. This

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose: This code block will only execute if the condition evaluates to True.
# IF statements allow your program to make decisions and execute code conditionally.

# SOLUTION EXPLANATION:
# This solution manually calculates the length of each word by iterating
# through its characters and counting them. It then appends only the length
# (not the word) to the result list, creating a list of integers.

# FUNCTION DEFINITION: 'length_words'
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose: This line defines a reusable function named 'length_words'.
# In Python, functions are defined using the 'def' keyword followed by the function name.
# Functions allow us to organize code into reusable blocks that can be called multiple times.
# Parameters: This function accepts 1 parameter(s): lst
# Parameters are variables that receive values when the function is called.
# They act as placeholders for the actual data that will be passed to the function.
# The colon (:) at the end is REQUIRED - it tells Python that the function body follows.
# The function body must be indented (typically 4 spaces) to show it belongs to this function.

# Purpose: This creates a new variable or updates an existing one with a value.
# In Python, variables are created when you first assign a value to them (no declaration needed).
# Variable name: 'length' - follows Python naming conventions (lowercase with underscores).
# Data Type: LIST - an ordered, mutable collection of items.
# Lists are created with square brackets [] and can contain any data types.

# Condition: index % 2 != 0:  # Check if index is odd (1, 3, 5, ...)
# Python evaluates this condition as either True or False (boolean values).
# Comparison operators: == (equal), != (not equal), < (less than), > (greater than), <=, >=
# Logical operators: 'and' (both true), 'or' (either true), 'not' (inverse)
# The colon (:) is REQUIRED - it indicates the start of the conditional block.
# The indented code below will only run if the condition is True.
# LEARNING NOTE: In Python, empty collections (empty list, string, etc.) are considered False.

# In Python, functions are defined using the 'def' keyword followed by the function name.
# Functions allow us to organize code into reusable blocks that can be called multiple times.
# Parameters: This function accepts 1 parameter(s): number
# Parameters are variables that receive values when the function is called.
# They act as placeholders for the actual data that will be passed to the function.
# The colon (:) at the end is REQUIRED - it tells Python that the function body follows.

# PROBLEM EXPLANATION:
# This problem requires finding both the minimum and maximum numbers in a list
# without using sort(), max(), or min() functions. The function should take a
# list of numbers and return a tuple containing both values. This requires
# manual comparison logic to find both extremes in a single pass through the list.
# 
# Key Requirements:
# - Function must accept a list of numbers
# - Must find both minimum and maximum values
# - Must NOT use sort() (as specified)
# - Must NOT use max() (as specified)
# - Must NOT use min() (as specified)
# - Should return a tuple (min, max)
# 
# Example Input/Output:
# - Input: [10, 90, 45, 55, 222, 2] → Output: (2, 222)
# 
# Algorithm: Single-pass iteration - track min and max as we go through the list.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose: This code block will only execute if the condition evaluates to True.
# IF statements allow your program to make decisions and execute code conditionally.
# Condition: x == 0
# Python evaluates this condition as either True or False (boolean values).
# Comparison operators: == (equal), != (not equal), < (less than), > (greater than), <=, >=
# Logical operators: 'and' (both true), 'or' (either true), 'not' (inverse)
# The colon (:) is REQUIRED - it indicates the start of the conditional block.
# The indented code below will only run if the condition is True.
# LEARNING NOTE: In Python, empty collections (empty list, string, etc.) are considered False.

# FUNCTION DEFINITION: 'longest_string'
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose: This line defines a reusable function named 'longest_string'.
# In Python, functions are defined using the 'def' keyword followed by the function name.
# Functions allow us to organize code into reusable blocks that can be called multiple times.
# Parameters: This function accepts 2 parameter(s): string, letter
# Parameters are variables that receive values when the function is called.
# They act as placeholders for the actual data that will be passed to the function.
# The colon (:) at the end is REQUIRED - it tells Python that the function body follows.
# The function body must be indented (typically 4 spaces) to show it belongs to this function.

# VARIABLE ASSIGNMENT: 'words'
# Purpose: This creates a new variable or updates an existing one with a value.
# In Python, variables are created when you first assign a value to them (no declaration needed).
# Variable name: 'words' - follows Python naming conventions (lowercase with underscores).
# This assigns the RESULT of a function call to the variable.
# The function executes first, and its return value is stored in the variable.
# LEARNING NOTE: Without parentheses, you'd be storing the function itself, not its result.

# Purpose: This code block will only execute if the condition evaluates to True.
# IF statements allow your program to make decisions and execute code conditionally.
# Condition: word.endswith(letter)
# Python evaluates this condition as either True or False (boolean values).
# Comparison operators: == (equal), != (not equal), < (less than), > (greater than), <=, >=
# Logical operators: 'and' (both true), 'or' (either true), 'not' (inverse)
# The colon (:) is REQUIRED - it indicates the start of the conditional block.
# The indented code below will only run if the condition is True.
# LEARNING NOTE: In Python, empty collections (empty list, string, etc.) are considered False.

# PRINT STATEMENT: Output to console
# Purpose: This displays text or values to the standard output (usually the terminal/console).
# The print() function is one of the most commonly used functions for debugging and user interaction.
# Printing: manager.assign_task("Prepare a project report"
# LEARNING NOTE: print() automatically converts values to strings and adds a newline at the end.
# You can print multiple items separated by commas - they'll be printed with spaces between them.
